# Social Graph Analysis and Visualization

This project involves analyzing the social graph of characters from a novel using Python and the NetworkX library. The analysis includes extracting the social graph, calculating centrality measures, visualizing the graph, and comparing it to various generative models.

## Project Overview

1. **Character List Compilation**:
   - Manually identified key characters in the novel.

2. **Social Graph Extraction**:
   - Extracted a social graph using a co-occurrence algorithm.
   - Visualized the graph using NetworkX.![Screenshot 2024-07-20 191838](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983147cc-7ec7-4ac9-be0f-cdd688466096)


3. **Centrality Measures Calculation**:
   - Calculated degree, betweenness, closeness, and PageRank centrality for main protagonists.

4. **Ego Network and Clustering Coefficient**:
   - Extracted ego networks and calculated local clustering coefficients for main protagonist nodes.

5. **Community Detection**:
   - Detected communities using Clique Percolation Method, Girvan Newman, and Louvain algorithm.

6. **Generative Model Comparison**:
   - Compared the social graph to generative models (Random Graph, Preferential Attachment, Small World) with 50 nodes.
